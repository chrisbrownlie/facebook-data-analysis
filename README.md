# Facebook data analysis
Code for analysis and cretating the visualisations used in my blog post series "What does Facebook know about me?" and the follow up article ['4.5 years of a relationship, in Facebook activity'](https://medium.com/@chris.brownlie/4-5-years-of-a-relationship-in-facebook-activity-13a8ddfc6a85?source=friends_link&sk=2be1c7440d1c3c5568001e6111de20ed).

I downloaded all my personal data from Facebook by going to 'Settings'->'Your Facebook Information'->'Download your information'. I then downloaded everything available in JSON format.

# Note
The code uses the myFacebook R package which I developed as part of this work. You can find more info [here](https://github.com/chrisbrownlie/myFacebook).

The script has not been tested or checked in any way. If you are unfamiliar with R it may take some time & effort for you to get this working on your own data, the same goes for the myFacebook R package.

Similiarly, the code is not well-commented. This is because for most people's purposes, the myFacebook package will be of more interest.
